# Masked Wrestlers Whitepaper

Welcome to the **Masked Wrestlers** whitepaper. This document explains the game, the asset model, and the technical design choices that keep the experience **skill-first**, **anti-exploit**, and **non-pay-to-win by design**.

Masked Wrestlers is a competitive 3D arena fighter inspired by classic lucha libre. Players build their style around a **Mask** (identity + rules), optional **Mask Accessories** (expression + option-expanding tools), and **Ring Gear** (boots, tights, shirt, cape) that provides tuned, capped bonuses.
