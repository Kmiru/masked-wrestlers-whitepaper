# Masked Wrestlers Whitepaper

Welcome to the **Masked Wrestlers** whitepaper. This document explains the game, the asset model, and the technical design choices that keep the experience **skill-first**, **anti-exploit**, and **non-pay-to-win by design**.

Masked Wrestlers is a **skill-first competitive 3D arena fighter** where your wins come from **reads, timing, movement, and mastery**—and where your loadout is built with **Masks, Patches (skills), and Ring Gear** you can collect and trade.

If you want a game that feels like **one more match… one more climb… one more outplay**, welcome to the arena.

## Why Masked Wrestlers hits different

### Competitive first — always
- Your climb reflects your improvement.
- Your wins feel earned.
- Your losses teach you something.

### Builds that actually change how you fight
Your loadout isn’t cosmetic fluff. It’s a system:
- **Mask** = your persona + tier foundation
- **Mask Accessories (Patches)** = skills/abilities + modifiers that shape your style
- **Ring Gear** = Boots / Tights / Top / Cape (your look + your presence)

---

## What you do

### Fight
- **Ranked PvP**: climb and prove it  
- **Casual PvP**: run sets, test builds, warm up  
- **Training / PvE (as supported)**: sharpen fundamentals and matchups  

### Progress
- Earn XP and climb **Level 1–1000**
- Unlock milestones that expand build access over time
- Become known for your style, not your spend

### Build your loadout
1) Equip your **Mask**
2) Add **Patches** (skills/modifiers) in available slots
3) Complete the look with **Ring Gear**: Boots / Tights / Top / Cape

## Competitive Integrity (so ranked stays legit)
Masked Wrestlers is designed with:
- **caps** (no runaway stacking)
- **tradeoffs + counterplay** (every advantage has answers)
- **tier/slot/level structure** (builds stay readable and fair)
- **anti-exploit protections** (no market abuse to cheat results)

When you win, it means something.
