# Utility token (if/when introduced)

If a utility token is introduced, it must serve the game—not replace it.

The only acceptable purpose is to support:
- events and tournaments
- community growth
- long-term ecosystem sustainability

And it must follow one rule above all:
**it can never compromise competitive integrity.**

## Player-first principles

### 1) Skill stays the ceiling
No token mechanic should translate into “buy wins.”

### 2) The ladder stays legitimate
No token feature should bypass:
- tier/slot rules
- progression gates
- caps/tradeoffs/counterplay

### 3) Clarity over complexity
Players should instantly understand:
- what it’s used for
- why it exists
- how it benefits the ecosystem

If a token can’t meet these principles, it doesn’t belong.
