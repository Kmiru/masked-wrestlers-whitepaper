# Optional utility token

A utility token is **optional**. If introduced, it must serve gameplay and community, not speculation.

Possible utilities (examples):

- tournament entry fees and prize pools,
- crafting / reroll sinks for cosmetic variants,
- seasonal battle-pass-like systems (strictly cosmetic or option-expanding within caps),
- community voting on cosmetic themes (non-governance-critical).

If a token is introduced, its parameters (supply, distribution, vesting) will be published transparently and audited.
