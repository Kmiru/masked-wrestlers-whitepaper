# Masked Wrestlers NFTs (What you’re actually collecting)

In Masked Wrestlers, NFTs are not “extra content.”
They’re the structure of your persona and your build system.

Your loadout is built around:
- **Mask** (identity + tier foundation)
- **Patches** (skills/modifiers)
- **Ring Gear** (Boots / Tights / Top / Cape)

---

## 1) Genesis Masks (ERC-721) — 1,000 total

### Why a fixed supply matters
Players want clarity.
A fixed Genesis supply creates:
- collectible identity
- long-term recognition
- clear rarity structure

### Tier split (designed for a healthy ecosystem)
- **700 Common**
- **250 Rare**
- **50 Legendary**

Tier does **not** mean “auto-win.”
Tier means **structured access to build expression**.

## 2) Tier → Slot expression (the real difference)

Masks define the structure of what you can slot:

### Common (foundation)
- Patch slots: **Trait**
- Trait access can require an early milestone (example: **Level ≥ 8**)

### Rare (more expression)
- Patch slots: **Trait + Moves**

### Legendary (highest expression, still bounded)
- Patch slots: **Trait + Moves + Power**
- Power is gated deeper (example: **Level ≥ 50**)

This keeps the ladder fair because:
- everyone plays within readable rules
- higher tiers unlock more *options*, not infinite power

---

## 3) Ring Gear (ERC-1155) — your signature look (and optional tuning within rules)

Ring Gear slots:
- **Boots**
- **Tights**
- **Top**
- **Cape**

Some gear can have requirements (example: advanced mobility capes can be **Level ≥ 50**).
The rule is simple: if gear affects gameplay, it follows the same integrity constraints:
caps, tradeoffs, counterplay.
