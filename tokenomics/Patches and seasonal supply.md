# Patches & seasonal supply (Skills, seasons, and the scale of builds)

Patches are where Masked Wrestlers becomes *your* game.

They don’t just decorate your Mask—Patches add **skills/abilities and modifiers** that shape how you fight. They’re the difference between “I play this game” and “this is my style.”

This page explains three things in a player-first way:
1) **What Patches do** (and why they’re exciting)  
2) **Why seasons exist** (and why supply is planned in cycles)  
3) **How big build creativity gets** (with real example numbers)

---

## 1) What Patches are (and why players care)

Patches are **Mask Accessories** that add **gameplay expression**:
- **Trait**: your rhythm and playstyle tuning  
- **Moves**: how your kit expresses itself  
- **Power**: high-tier expression (still bounded, still answerable)

They’re designed to support different player identities:
- pressure specialists
- control and punish players
- defense-to-counter tacticians
- movement and mixup artists

The goal is simple:
**your build should feel like your hands and your brain.**

---

## 2) The Patch system in clean numbers

A full “maximum expression” build is made of:
- **1 Mask**
- **3 Patch slots** (Trait / Moves / Power)
- **4 Ring Gear slots** (Boots / Tights / Top / Cape)

That’s the core loadout structure behind the ecosystem.

Progression runs **Level 1–1000**, and access to deeper expression can be milestone-gated for balance.

---

## 3) Why seasons exist (the real reason)

Competitive players don’t build once and stop.
They:
- test styles
- swap pieces
- adapt to the meta
- chase new themes
- optimize for matchups

That means the ecosystem needs a steady flow of Patch availability so the market stays alive and builds stay accessible.

### The “one full cycle” baseline (why it’s not enough)
Using the Genesis Mask tier split example:
- **700 Common**
- **250 Rare**
- **50 Legendary**

And the slot structure example:
- Common: **1 Patch slot**
- Rare: **2 Patch slots**
- Legendary: **3 Patch slots**

The max “equip everyone once” baseline is:

- Common: 700 × 1 = **700**
- Rare: 250 × 2 = **500**
- Legendary: 50 × 3 = **150**
= **1,350 total Patch slots** filled one time

That’s only **one** cycle. Real demand is higher because players respec and the ecosystem evolves.

---

## 4) Season 0 supply (launch / first year example)

Season 0 is designed to feel playable, liquid, and alive—not dry and impossible.

**25,000 total Patches**
- **17,500 Common (70%)**
- **6,250 Rare (25%)**
- **1,250 Legendary (5%)**

Why this split feels right to players:
- Common stays abundant enough for experimentation and trading
- Rare stays meaningful while still reachable
- Legendary stays scarce and exciting without being “unobtainable”

A simple way to understand the scale:
- Baseline “one full equip cycle” = **1,350**
- Season 0 supply = **25,000**
- **25,000 / 1,350 ≈ 18.5 cycles** worth of total slot-filling in aggregate

That supports:
- players trying multiple builds
- new players joining
- seasons creating churn
- a real market with liquidity

---

## 5) Seasonal replenishment (why the ecosystem keeps breathing)

To keep builds accessible and the market healthy, each season can introduce:

**5,000–12,000 new Patches per season** (scaled to demand)

How to read the range:
- closer to **12k** when growth + consumption are high
- closer to **5k** when the ecosystem is early / niche

The purpose is to balance two extremes:
- too little supply → prices spike, builds become inaccessible, new players struggle
- too much supply → dilution, items feel less meaningful, weaker collection value

Seasons are the control knob that keeps the economy **fun**, **liquid**, and **fair**.

---

## 6) Build scale (how many loadouts are possible?)

Now the part that makes this ecosystem feel *big*.

Here’s a **concrete example v1 catalog** used to show scale:

### Patches (60 total)
- 10 Common Trait
- 10 Rare Trait
- 10 Rare Moves
- 10 Legendary Trait
- 10 Legendary Moves
- 10 Legendary Power  
= **60 Patches**

### Ring Gear (80 total)
- 20 Boots
- 20 Tights
- 20 Top
- 20 Cape  
= **80 Ring Gear**

Total example components: **140 items**.

---

### 6.1 Ring Gear combinations alone (per Mask)
With 20 items per gear slot:

- Boots: 20 choices  
- Tights: 20 choices  
- Top: 20 choices  
- Cape: 20 choices  

That’s:

**20 × 20 × 20 × 20 = 160,000** gear combinations

And that’s before Patch skills even enter the picture.

---

### 6.2 Patch combinations (by tier structure)
Using the v1 example counts:

#### Common-tier Patch options (example structure)
- Trait slot: 10 options  
Patch combinations: **10**

#### Rare-tier Patch options (example structure)
- Trait: 10 options  
- Moves: 10 options  
Patch combinations: **10 × 10 = 100**

#### Legendary-tier Patch options (example structure)
- Trait: 10 options  
- Moves: 10 options  
- Power: 10 options  
Patch combinations: **10 × 10 × 10 = 1,000**

---

### 6.3 Total loadout combinations (per Mask) — upper bounds
Multiply Patch combos × Gear combos:

#### Common example
- Patch combos: 10  
- Gear combos: 160,000  
= **1,600,000** loadouts per Mask

#### Rare example
- Patch combos: 100  
- Gear combos: 160,000  
= **16,000,000** loadouts per Mask

#### Legendary example
- Patch combos: 1,000  
- Gear combos: 160,000  
= **160,000,000** loadouts per Mask

> These are theoretical upper bounds. Balance, caps, and counterplay determine which builds are truly meta-viable.

---

## 7) Why this matters (the player takeaway)

This system creates three big player wins:

### 1) You can specialize
You can build toward a style that fits your hands:
pressure, control, defense, aerial/mixups, timing mastery.

### 2) The meta stays alive
Structured variety produces:
- theorycrafting
- matchup prep
- adaptation
- rivalries and “build identity” culture

### 3) Ranked stays legitimate
Even with huge variety, fairness is protected because the system enforces:
- caps
- tradeoffs
- counterplay
- tier/slot/level rules
- anti-exploit protections

**That’s the goal: tons of expression, zero pay-to-win.**
