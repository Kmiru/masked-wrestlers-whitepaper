# Patches & seasonal supply (Skills you build with)

Patches are where the game gets personal.
They add **skills/abilities and modifiers** that shape how you fight.

They’re designed to create:
- specialization paths (pressure, control, defense, mixups)
- matchup strategy
- a meta that evolves through seasons

---

## Patch structure (clean and competitive)

Patch slots:
- **Trait** (playstyle tuning)
- **Moves** (kit expression)
- **Power** (high-tier expression, still bounded)

Tier rules keep everything readable:
- Patch tier must match Mask tier
- Slot access depends on Mask tier + progression gates

Example gates used for fairness:
- Common Trait begins at **Level ≥ 8**
- Power requires **Level ≥ 50**

---

## Why seasons exist (the “living meta” reason)

Because players change builds.
A lot.

Even if there were a theoretical “max slots used once” across the whole Genesis supply:
- 700 Common × 1 slot = 700
- 250 Rare × 2 slots = 500
- 50 Legendary × 3 slots = 150
= **1,350 total patch slots** (single pass)

In reality, patch demand is higher because:
- players test multiple styles
- balance updates shift the meta
- new players join continuously
- seasonal content refreshes goals

Seasonal releases keep the ecosystem active instead of frozen.

## Concrete Season 0 supply target (launch / first year)

**25,000 total Patches**
- **17,500 Common (70%)**
- **6,250 Rare (25%)**
- **1,250 Legendary (5%)**

Then, for ongoing seasons:
- **5,000–12,000 Patches per season**
Scaled based on demand and player growth.

---

## Why this doesn’t become pay-to-win
Because supply doesn’t override rules.

Patches remain fair through:
- hard slot limits (you can only slot what your Mask tier supports)
- level gates (access is earned through play)
- caps + tradeoffs (no “stack forever”)
- counterplay (opponents always have answers)

This is how you get a market that stays exciting
*without* breaking competitive integrity.




# Build Math (How many loadouts are possible?)

This page is here for one reason:
to show the *scale* of creativity you get from a structured, competitive build system.

Masked Wrestlers uses a **7-piece loadout**:
1) Mask
2) Patch: Trait
3) Patch: Moves
4) Patch: Power
5) Boots
6) Tights
7) Top
8) Cape

(That’s 1 Mask + 3 Patch slots + 4 Ring Gear slots.)

Your progression runs **Level 1–1000**, and access to slots can be milestone-gated for balance.

---

## A concrete example catalog (v1 scale)
A realistic v1 catalog can look like:

### Patches (60 total)
- 10 Common Trait
- 10 Rare Trait
- 10 Rare Moves
- 10 Legendary Trait
- 10 Legendary Moves
- 10 Legendary Power

= **60 Patches**

### Ring Gear (80 total)
- 20 Boots
- 20 Tights
- 20 Top
- 20 Cape

= **80 Ring Gear**

Total example components: **140 items**.

---

## Ring Gear combinations alone (per Mask)
With 20 items per gear slot:

- Boots: 20 choices  
- Tights: 20 choices  
- Top: 20 choices  
- Cape: 20 choices  

That’s:

**20 × 20 × 20 × 20 = 160,000** Ring Gear looks/builds

And that’s before adding any Patch skills.

---

## Patch combinations (by tier structure)
Using the v1 example counts:

### Common-tier Patch options (example structure)
- Trait slot: 10 options  
- Moves slot: (not available)  
- Power slot: (not available)  

Patch combinations: **10**

### Rare-tier Patch options (example structure)
- Trait slot: 10 options  
- Moves slot: 10 options  
- Power slot: (not available)  

Patch combinations: **10 × 10 = 100**

### Legendary-tier Patch options (example structure)
- Trait slot: 10 options  
- Moves slot: 10 options  
- Power slot: 10 options  

Patch combinations: **10 × 10 × 10 = 1,000**

---

## Total loadout combinations (per Mask) — example upper bounds
Multiply Patch combos × Gear combos:

### Common example
- Patch combos: 10  
- Gear combos: 160,000  
= **1,600,000** loadouts per Mask

### Rare example
- Patch combos: 100  
- Gear combos: 160,000  
= **16,000,000** loadouts per Mask

### Legendary example
- Patch combos: 1,000  
- Gear combos: 160,000  
= **160,000,000** loadouts per Mask

---

## The real takeaway (why this matters)
This scale creates three powerful player outcomes:

### 1) You can specialize
You can build toward a style that fits your hands:
pressure, control, defense, aerial/mixups, timing mastery.

### 2) The meta stays alive
A structured loadout system creates theorycrafting, matchup prep, and adaptation.

### 3) Ranked can stay fair
Even with huge variety, fairness stays protected when the system enforces:
- caps
- tradeoffs
- counterplay
- tier/slot/level rules
- anti-exploit protections

That’s the goal:
**tons of expression, zero pay-to-win.**
