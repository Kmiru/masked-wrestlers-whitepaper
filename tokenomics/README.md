# Tokenomics

Masked Wrestlers is designed like a competitive game should be: **fair, readable, and rewarding**.
Tokenomics exists to support three things players actually care about:

1) **Competitive integrity** (wins stay meaningful)  
2) **Build depth** (Patches that change how you fight)  
3) **A living ecosystem** (seasons that keep goals fresh without power creep)

This section explains the economy in player terms:
- what exists
- how scarce it is
- how seasons refresh supply
- why the ladder doesn’t turn into pay-to-win

---

## The economy at a glance (numbers you can understand)

### Genesis Masks (ERC-721)
- **1,000 total** (fixed, collectible clarity)
- Tier split designed for healthy matchmaking + identity variety:
  - **700 Common**
  - **250 Rare**
  - **50 Legendary**

### Patches (ERC-1155) — Skills & modifiers
- Released in **seasons** because Patches are meant to be actively used by players
- **Season 0 (launch / first year) target:** **25,000 total Patches**
  - **70% Common** (17,500)
  - **25% Rare** (6,250)
  - **5% Legendary** (1,250)
- **Ongoing seasons:** **5,000–12,000** new Patches (scaled to demand)

### Ring Gear (ERC-1155) — Boots / Tights / Top / Cape
- Initial drop scale example:
  - **80 items total**
  - **20 per slot** (Boots, Tights, Top, Cape)

## Why this structure is powerful for players

### 1) Scarcity you can actually track
A fixed 1,000 Genesis supply keeps identity collectible and easy to understand.

### 2) A “living build meta” that doesn’t freeze
Patches are released seasonally so:
- the market doesn’t dry out
- players can keep experimenting
- the meta can evolve without breaking fairness

### 3) No pay-to-win by design
Tokenomics doesn’t decide outcomes—skill does.
Build impact stays fair through:
- slot limits
- tier restrictions
- level gates
- global caps + tradeoffs + counterplay

---

## The player promise
Tokenomics is built so you can:
- chase goals
- refine a signature style
- evolve across seasons

…while the ladder stays legitimate.
