# Roadmap (Execution plan)

Masked Wrestlers is being developed in stages that prioritize:
1) fun and competitive clarity,
2) integrity protections,
3) scalable content pipelines,
4) ecosystem utility only after the gameplay loop is proven.

This roadmap is structured to minimize risk, maximize player trust, and create a sustainable competitive scene.

---

## Phase 1 — Documentation & web presence
- Finalize whitepaper and ecosystem rules (player-first clarity)
- Launch website as the official hub (docs, catalog references, verified links, announcements)
- Establish community channels and feedback loops

---

## Phase 2 — Funding & awareness (memecoin)
- Launch a memecoin to support development and marketing
- Maintain clear separation between funding mechanisms and competitive integrity
- Publish transparency on usage: development, art, infrastructure, testing, and community growth

---

## Phase 3 — Vertical slice (playable proof)
- Deliver a playable core prototype:
  - movement/spacing/timing/stamina fundamentals
  - at least one arena and a small roster of wrestlers
  - early game modes that define the core loop
- Implement the first end-to-end loadout loop:
  Mask → Patch slots → Ring Gear (Boots/Tights/Top/Cape)

---

## Phase 4 — Content & platform buildout
- Expand production pipelines:
  - Masks (tiers, catalog IDs, identity)
  - Patches (skills/modifiers with caps, tradeoffs, counterplay)
  - Ring Gear (Boots/Tights/Top/Cape)
- Expand wrestlers, arenas, and game mode variety
- Implement platform foundations:
  accounts, matchmaking, progression hooks, inventory/loadout UX

---

## Phase 5 — Closed alpha (integrity validation)
- Conduct closed testing focused on:
  balance, exploit prevention, matchmaking performance,
  patch impact vs skill impact, and progression pacing
- Iterate on findings and tighten integrity protections

---

## Phase 6 — Iteration & polish
- Combat tuning and balance refinement
- Patch system tuning (caps/tradeoffs, restrictions if needed)
- Stability improvements and performance optimization
- UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements

---

## Phase 7 — Public beta (scale validation)
- Increase player access
- Stress test infrastructure and matchmaking
- Establish live balance process and communication cadence
- Run structured community events for competitive validation

---

## Phase 8 — Launch v1
- Ship core experience:
  ranked/casual/training loops,
  Level progression (Level 1–1000),
  v1 catalog (Masks/Patches/Gear),
  official website hub fully aligned
- Integrate marketplace rules without compromising match integrity

---

## Phase 9 — Utility token launch (ecosystem utility)
- Launch utility token after gameplay utility is established
- Intended uses:
  purchase of Masks/NFTs, platform/marketplace fees (as applicable),
  event entry fees, and ecosystem services
- Introduce wagering/betting later with strict integrity and compliance controls

---

## Phase 10 — Post-launch upgrades
- Prioritize bug fixes, balance patches, QoL improvements
- Security hardening and anti-exploit upgrades
- Ongoing content tuning based on real player behavior

---

## Phase 11 — Season 1
- Release Season 1 content:
  new Patch sets, new Gear collections,
  seasonal themes and goals, and expanded event formats
- Continue balance philosophy: variety without power creep
