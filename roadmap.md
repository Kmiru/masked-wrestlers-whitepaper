# Roadmap (From vision to a real competitive scene)

Masked Wrestlers is being built the way competitive games earn trust:
**show the game, prove the fun, protect integrity, then scale content and seasons.**

This roadmap reflects the planned journey from documentation and community-building
to a playable arena fighter with a living economy and Season 1 content.

---

## Phase 1 — Whitepaper + Website (Clarity, trust, community)

### What happens
- Whitepaper and documentation finalized (player-first language)
- Website launch (official hub: docs, catalog info, verified links, announcements)
- Community channels opened and structured (early supporters + feedback loop)
- Early previews of Masks, Patches, Ring Gear direction (visual + system explanation)

### What players get
- A clear understanding of how the game works
- A reason to follow early and join the community
- Confidence that the project is building something real

---

## Phase 2 — Funding launch (Memecoin for momentum)

### What happens
- Memecoin launch as a funding + community growth vehicle
- Clear messaging: memecoin supports development, not ranked power
- Transparency: how funds are used (dev, art, infrastructure, testing, events)

### What players get
- A rally point for community momentum
- Faster development and bigger reach
- More frequent drops of previews, concepts, and progress

---

## Phase 3 — Vertical slice (Make the game feel addictive)

### What happens
- Core combat prototype (movement, spacing, timing, stamina rhythm)
- At least one arena + a small roster of wrestlers (baseline kits)
- Basic match types (the ones that define the identity of the game)
- Early loadout structure working end-to-end:
  - Mask → Patch slots → Gear slots (Boots/Tights/Top/Cape)

### Why this comes before “tons of content”
Because once the game is playable, you can balance around reality:
- what feels fun
- what breaks the ladder
- what players actually use

### What players get
- Proof that this is a real competitive game
- Early meta, early rivalries, early clips

---

## Phase 4 — Content production (Scale the world)

### What happens
- Masks production pipeline (tiers, traits, catalog IDs)
- Patches production pipeline (skills/modifiers with caps/tradeoffs/counterplay)
- Ring Gear production pipeline (Boots/Tights/Top/Cape collections)
- Wrestlers expansion (more kits, more matchup variety)
- Arenas expansion (readable, competitive-safe layouts)
- Platform foundations (accounts, matchmaking, progression hooks)

### What players get
- More variety, more identity, more matchups
- More ways to specialize without breaking fairness

---

## Phase 5 — Closed Test (Alpha: prove the integrity)

### What happens
- Closed alpha test with limited players
- Focus areas:
  - balance and counterplay
  - exploit prevention
  - matchmaking and latency performance
  - patch impact vs skill impact
  - progression pacing sanity checks

### What players get
- Early access (for a controlled group)
- The first “real ladder feel” feedback loop

---

## Phase 6 — Iteration (Fix, tune, polish)

### What happens
- Combat tuning (timing windows, stamina, movement)
- Patch tuning (caps/tradeoffs, banned interactions, clarity)
- UI/UX polish (loadouts, inventory, match flow)
- Stability improvements and performance optimization

### What players get
- Cleaner fights
- More readable builds
- Less frustration, more mastery

---

## Phase 7 — Public Test (Beta: grow the community)

### What happens
- Broader beta access
- Stress testing matchmaking and platform
- Meta stabilization and live balance processes
- Community formats (events, creator content support)

### What players get
- Wider access
- A real sense of a growing scene
- The start of long-term culture

---

## Phase 8 — Launch v1 (The arena opens)

### What ships
- Ranked + casual + training loop
- Level progression (Level 1–1000)
- v1 catalog (Masks/Patches/Gear) with clear rules
- Official website hub fully aligned
- Marketplace rules integrated (without compromising ranked)

### What players get
- A ladder that means something
- Builds that express style
- Identity that becomes recognizable

---

## Phase 9 — Utility Token launch (Fuel the ecosystem)

### Token utility (player-facing)
- Buy Masks / NFTs and marketplace interactions
- Pay platform/marketplace fees (as applicable)
- Event entry fees and ecosystem services
- Wagers/bets introduced later under strict integrity + compliance controls

### What players get
- A unified currency for ecosystem utility
- Features that connect gameplay → economy → events

---

## Phase 10 — Post-launch upgrades (Finish what matters)

### What happens
- Priority bug fixes and balance patches
- QoL improvements (match flow, training tools, inventory)
- Anti-exploit upgrades and security hardening
- Communication cadence (patch notes, dev updates)

### What players get
- Trust: the game is supported
- Stability: the ladder stays legitimate

---

## Phase 11 — Season 1 (The ecosystem starts breathing)

### What happens
- New Patch sets (skills/modifiers designed with counterplay)
- New Gear collections (Boots/Tights/Top/Cape)
- New themes and goals
- Events/tournaments that start building the scene

### What players get
- Fresh goals and new builds
- New identity culture
