# Roadmap (Competitive-first. Player-first. Built to become a real scene.)

Masked Wrestlers is built around one promise:

**Make the game insanely fun first — then grow the ecosystem without breaking ranked.**


---

## Guiding principles (what never changes)

### 1) Skill stays the ceiling
Wins come from reads, timing, movement, stamina/resource decisions, and matchup mastery.

### 2) Builds add expression, not auto-wins
Patches add skills/modifiers, but fairness is enforced through:
caps, tradeoffs, counterplay, tier/slot/level structure, and anti-exploit protections.

### 3) Ship in the order that creates a real scene
**Fun → Fairness → Progression → Market → Token Utility → Seasons → Events/Tournaments → Wagers**

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation (Make the arena feel incredible)
**Goal:** the combat “clicks” fast and has a mastery ceiling you can grind for years.

### What ships
- Core combat loop (movement, spacing, timing, stamina rhythm)
- Readable punish windows and consistent rules
- Baseline playstyles supported (pressure / control / defense / aerial-mixup)
- Loadout framework defined (Mask + Patches + Ring Gear slots)

### What players get
- Clean fights that feel competitive from day one
- The first “one more match” addiction loop
- Identity structure: Boots / Tights / Top / Cape

---

## Phase 1 — Progression & Identity (Your legend starts forming)
**Goal:** give players progression that feels meaningful every session.

### What ships
- XP progression: **Level 1–1000**
- Milestone gates to protect balance (slot access can be level-gated)
- Loadout UI/UX:
  - Mask selection
  - Patch slotting (Trait / Moves / Power where applicable)
  - Ring Gear: Boots / Tights / Top / Cape
- Player identity surfaces (profiles, loadout display, recognizable Mask presence)

### What players get
- Long-term goals that reward consistency
- A persona that becomes recognizable
- Clear reasons to return: milestones, build refinement, specialization

---

## Phase 2 — Catalog v1 (Real build variety, real choices)
**Goal:** launch with enough variety to create theorycrafting and real meta churn.

### What ships
- Initial Patch sets across tiers and slots (skills/modifiers with counterplay)
- Ring Gear variety across 4 slots (Boots/Tights/Top/Cape)
- Balance rules that keep builds readable:
  tier restrictions, slot restrictions, caps + tradeoffs + counterplay

### What players get
- Build creativity at scale
- Real matchup prep and “build identity” culture
- The feeling that your loadout actually reflects your style

---

## Phase 3 — Competitive systems (Ranked that means something)
**Goal:** protect the ladder so the scene can grow without collapsing.

### What ships
- Ranked ladder rules and progression clarity
- Match integrity mechanisms (results correspond to real builds)
- Anti-exploit protections around equipping and rewards
- Competitive quality-of-life:
  rematch flow, set flow (best-of support), training refinements

### What players get
- A ladder you can take seriously
- Wins that feel respected
- A competitive environment strong players want to stay in

---

## Phase 4 — Marketplace loop (Curate your toolkit)
**Goal:** turn “random inventory” into “competitive curation.”

### What ships
- Marketplace integration rules that prioritize fairness
- Clear asset/equip rules so the market stays exciting without affecting match legitimacy
- Official website hub integration:
  verified links, catalog references, drop announcements, documentation

### What players get
- Trade toward the style that fits your hands
- A living inventory that evolves with the ecosystem
- Collection that feels tied to gameplay identity, not just visuals

---

## Phase 5 — Token launch (Fuel for the ecosystem)
**Goal:** introduce a token that powers the economy loop without compromising competitive integrity.

### Token utility (player-facing)
The token is designed to be used for:
- **Buying Masks and NFTs** (primary marketplace utility)
- **Paying platform fees** (minting/marketplace/transaction-related fees as applicable)
- **Event entry fees** (tournaments, leagues, special formats)
- **Ecosystem services** (crafting, upgrades, nameplates, cosmetics, seasonal utilities—where designed)
- **Wagers / bets** (introduced with strict integrity + compliance controls; see Phase 7)

### What players get
- A unified way to interact with the ecosystem
- Clear utility that connects gameplay → economy → community growth
- A token that supports the scene instead of replacing skill

### Non-negotiables (to protect players)
- The token must **never** allow pay-to-win outcomes in ranked
- Utility must respect caps/tradeoffs/counterplay and build rules
- Systems must prevent abuse loops and protect match integrity

---

## Phase 6 — Seasons (The ecosystem starts breathing)
**Goal:** keep the game fresh without power creep.

### What ships
- Seasonal cadence with:
  - new themes
  - new Patch sets (skills/modifiers built with counterplay)
  - new Gear collections (Boots / Tights / Top / Cape)
- Seasonal goals that reward participation and mastery
- Ongoing balance philosophy:
  variety without “must-have dominance,” caps/tradeoffs to prevent runaway metas

### What players get
- New reasons to return (without deleting your mastery)
- New build journeys, new rivals, new identity culture
- “Season X gear”, “that Patch meta”, “that rivalry arc” moments

---

## Phase 7 — Events, tournaments, and wagers (The scene becomes real)
**Goal:** create moments that turn players into names—while keeping everything fair and compliant.

### Events & tournaments
- Official competitive formats and community events
- Brackets/leagues that reward consistency and mastery
- Tools and flows that support a real competitive calendar

### Wagers / bets (separate integrity layer)
Wagers are introduced in a controlled way:
- Wagers are designed around **match integrity** (anti-collusion / anti-exploit protections)
- Clear separation from ranked outcomes (ranked remains skill-first and protected)
- Compliance-first approach (regional availability, age gates, limits, and responsible-play safeguards where required)

### What players get
- High-stakes matches that feel electric
- A reason to run sets and prove it under pressure
- Competitive culture that produces stories, rivalries, and legends

---

## Phase 8 — Expansion (Only what strengthens the arena)
**Goal:** expand features that increase replay value without compromising integrity.

Possible expansion areas (driven by balance readiness and community demand):
- new arenas and competitive-safe rule variants
- deeper training tools
- creator/community features that grow the scene
- additional progression layers that reward mastery (not spending)

---

## What you can expect from every update (always)
- Competitive-first tuning
- Clear rules and readable builds
- More identity and more choices
- Integrity protections that keep the ladder legitimate

Masked Wrestlers is being built to become the kind of competitive game players don’t leave —
because the fights stay real, the builds stay deep, and the culture keeps evolving.
