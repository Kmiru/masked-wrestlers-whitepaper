# Web3 gaming and ownership (Optional, not required)

In Masked Wrestlers, ownership is optional and designed around competitive protection.

## If you play without NFTs
You can still:
- Play ranked/casual
- Level up (XP → Level 1–1000)
- Unlock progression-based milestones
- Participate in events and the community

**A wallet is not required to enjoy the core game.**

## If you play with NFTs (optional)
Ownership can add:
- Collectible identity (Genesis masks, seasonal cosmetics)
- Optional tradability (depending on item type and rules)
- A richer identity layer for your profile and community presence

## How ownership stays fair
To keep the game skill-first, the system uses:
### Tier locks
- Common accessories ↔ Common masks  
- Rare accessories ↔ Rare masks  
- Legendary accessories ↔ Legendary masks  

### Slot rules (by mask tier)
- Common: **Trait**
- Rare: **Trait + Moves**
- Legendary: **Trait + Moves + Power** (Power only exists here)

### Level gates (earned through play)
- Common Trait slot unlocks at **Level ≥ 8**
- Legendary Power unlocks at **Level ≥ 50**

### Anti-exploit protections
- Items that affect builds can be **locked/escrowed while equipped**
- Matches bind to a **loadout hash** so you can’t swap advantages mid-flow
- Progression can be credited only from **authorized match receipts**

## What you actually gain
- Optional ownership that supports identity and community
- Tradability that doesn’t break ranked integrity
- A system where skill is the ceiling—not spending
