# Web3 gaming and ownership

---

## If you play WITHOUT NFTs

You can still:
- Play **ranked** and **casual**
- Train in **PvE / practice** to improve
- Gain **XP → Level 1–1000**
- Unlock progression milestones
- Participate in events and community features (as available)

**Your skill and progression are real either way.**

## If you play WITH NFTs

### What you gain
NFTs unlock three practical benefits:

#### 1) Ownership of your identity
Your Mask and items are **yours**:
- keep them long-term
- move them (where supported)
- trade them on supported marketplaces

#### 2) Loadout flexibility through the market
Instead of being stuck with random drops:
- trade items you don’t use
- buy items that match your style
- rebuild your loadout without “starting over”

#### 3) A deeper identity loop
Your persona becomes persistent:
- Mask = your core identity
- Accessories = how you express playstyle (skills/modifiers)
- Ring Gear = your visual signature

## What you can DO with Web3 in Masked Wrestlers

### A) Equip NFTs to define your build
Your equipped items form your loadout:
1) **1 Mask NFT** (Common / Rare / Legendary)
2) **Mask Accessories** (slot-based: Trait / Moves / Power)
3) **Ring Gear** (boots / tights / top / cape)

This lets you customize within a system that protects fairness:
- tier rules
- slot rules
- level gates
- global caps + tradeoffs + counterplay

---

### B) Trade NFTs to shape your preferred style
If you know the style you enjoy (pressure, control, defense, aerial), the market helps you:
- find the pieces that fit
- swap out pieces that don’t
- complete themed sets across seasons

This is **not** about buying wins. It’s about buying **options** and then winning with skill.

---

### C) Collect seasonal culture drops
Seasonal releases can add:
- new themes and cosmetic variants
- new accessory sets designed with caps/tradeoffs
- event-linked items that carry community meaning

As a player, this gives you:
- fresh goals
- new identity paths
- more reasons to return each season

---

## How the game stays fair

To protect competitive integrity:
- Build-impact items can be **locked/escrowed while equipped**
- Match rewards can be bound to your **loadout hash**
- Ranked progression can require **authorized match receipts**

This prevents exploit patterns like:
“equip → win → instantly sell → repeat.”

---

## Where you interact with Web3

- **In-game:** equip, build, play, level up
- **Website:** official docs, contract links, drops, events
- **Marketplace:** trade supported items under the rules

---

## The player promise
- You can play and compete without NFTs.
- If you choose NFTs, you gain ownership + flexibility + identity + modifiers
- Ranked remains skill-first because the system enforces caps, tradeoffs, and anti-exploit protections.
