# Market overview (How it works for players)

## In a nutshell
Masked Wrestlers is a **skill-first competitive fighting game** with an **optional ownership layer** (NFTs) designed so ownership **never bypasses skill**.

### What you can do
- Play **Competitive PvP** (ranked and casual)
- Train in **PvE** to learn matchups and mechanics
- Hang out in a **social lobby** (identity + cosmetics)
- Join **tournaments / seasonal events** (as the community grows)

### What you earn (by playing)
- **XP → Level 1–1000 progression**
- **Unlocks** (slots, access to build options, cosmetic paths)
- **Seasonal rewards** (examples: cosmetics, accessory drops, themes)

> The core game remains playable **without NFTs**. A wallet is optional.

### How builds work (simple)
Your build (loadout) is made of:
1) **1 Mask** (tiered: Common / Rare / Legendary)  
2) Optional **Mask Accessories** (slot-based: Trait / Moves / Power)  
3) Optional **Ring Gear** (boots / tights / top / cape)

Everything that affects your build is designed with:
- **tier locks**
- **slot rules**
- **level gates**
- **global caps + tradeoffs**
- **anti-exploit protections** (equip lock/escrow; match-bound loadout)

### Where & when
- **In-game:** matches, training, social lobby
- **Website:** official links, contracts, whitepaper, drops, tournament info, leaderboards
- **Marketplace (optional):** trade assets **only** under the lock/escrow rules
- **Seasons:** new cosmetic themes and accessory releases over time (cadence may vary)
