# Competitive fighting games

If you’ve played serious fighting games, you already know what matters. 

## As a player
### Gameplay first
- The initial focus is **competitive 1v1**
- You can also use **PvE training** to learn mechanics and matchups
- A **social lobby** supports community + cosmetic expression

### Competitive integrity built-in
- Builds are bounded by **caps and tradeoffs**
- Higher tiers offer **more options**, not unchecked power
- The system prevents “equip → fight → sell” exploit loops via locking rules
- A clear path: learn → level → unlock options → refine your style
