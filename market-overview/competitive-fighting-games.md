# Competitive fighting games

---

## What you can DO as a competitive player

### A) Play ranked with real stakes
Ranked is where your improvement shows:
- climb divisions by winning through skill
- learn from losses and adapt
- build consistency under pressure

### B) Play casual to experiment
Casual is where you test ideas:
- try new approaches without ladder pressure
- practice matchup knowledge
- warm up mechanics before ranked

### C) Train to improve faster
Training (PvE/practice) helps you:
- learn spacing, timing, and stamina control
- drill combos and punishes
- build muscle memory for your style

---

## What you GAIN by playing

### 1) Skill progression
You get better at:
- reads (predicting reactions)
- neutral (positioning and footsies)
- timing (punish windows, interrupts)
- resource management (stamina, cooldown rhythm)

### 2) Account progression (XP → Level 1–1000)
Winning and playing earns XP that turns into:
- Level milestones
- unlock access to build options over time (earned, not bought)
- long-term goals that reward commitment

### 3) Loadout progression
Your build is:
- **1 Mask**
- **Mask Accessories** (skills/modifiers)
- **Ring Gear** (boots / tights / top / cape)

As you progress, you gain access to more **choices**—but ranked remains fair because:
- bonuses are capped
- tradeoffs create real counterplay
- tiers control what slots exist

## Why ranked stays FAIR

### Caps + tradeoffs
Even if something helps your style, it comes with:
- a downside
- a counterplay angle
- and global caps that prevent “stat stacking”

### Tier and slot rules
- Common / Rare / Legendary tiers define *what kinds of options exist*
- Higher tiers mean more customization paths—not automatic wins

### Anti-exploit protections
To keep match outcomes legitimate:
- equipped items can be **locked/escrowed while in use**
- match rewards can bind to your **loadout hash**
- authorized match receipts prevent fake claims

This keeps the ladder meaningful.

## What kind of competitor you can become

The system supports multiple styles:
- **Pressure:** stay close, force mistakes, maintain tempo
- **Control:** spacing, punish overcommitments, win by reads
- **Defense:** survive, reset, and turn the fight with patience
- **Aerial / Mixups:** movement, timing traps, unpredictable patterns


---

## Your competitive path

1) **Start playing**
2) **Pick a style** you enjoy
3) **Grind XP → Level**
4) **Refine your build choices** as you unlock options
5) **Climb ranked** through mastery and adaptation

---

## What you get at the end of the grind
- a ladder you can take seriously
- a skill ceiling you can chase for years
- a build identity that evolves with your playstyle
- fairness protected so wins mean something
