# The NFT market

## Why NFTs matter to you as a player

### 1) You actually own your gear
If you choose to use NFTs, your Mask and items are **yours**:
- You can keep them long-term
- You can trade them on supported marketplaces
- You can move them between wallets (where supported)

Ownership is about **control and flexibility**—not forcing you to buy power.

---

### 2) You can build a personal “loadout identity”
Your build is your brand. NFTs make that identity persistent:
- Your **Mask NFT** is your core persona (tiered)
- **Mask Accessories (Patches)** customize your playstyle within caps/tradeoffs
- **Ring Gear** lets you express style (boots/tights/shirt/cape)

Over time, you can curate a look and a build that feels like *you*.

---

### 3) You can earn progression AND collect
Even if progression comes from playing (XP → Level 1–1000), NFTs can add a **collection loop**:
- Seasonal accessory drops (optional ownership)
- Cosmetic variants tied to themes/events
- Gear sets that represent seasons, tournaments, or milestones

This gives you more reasons to log in, grind, and refine your style.

## What you can do with your NFTs (player actions)

### A) Equip them to play with your chosen build
- Equip **1 Mask NFT**
- Equip **Patches** in available slots (Trait / Moves / Power)
- Equip **Ring Gear** in 4 slots (boots / tights / shirt / cape)

Your equipped items define your build—always bounded by:
- tier rules
- slot rules
- level requirements
- global caps + tradeoffs + counterplay

---

### B) Trade NFTs you don’t want, and upgrade your collection
If you get items you don’t use:
- Sell them
- Trade them for items that fit your playstyle
- Complete a themed set (season culture drops)
- Rebuild your loadout without “starting over” as a player

This is the biggest player advantage of NFTs: **you can reconfigure your inventory through the market**.

---

### C) Use the market to specialize (without breaking fairness)
You can choose a specialization path:
- “Fast pressure” identity
- “Defensive patience” identity
- “Aerial mixups” identity
- “Timing/control” identity

The market helps you **find the exact pieces** to express that style—but competitive integrity stays intact because:
- bonuses are capped
- every strength has tradeoffs
- high tier means more *options*, not guaranteed wins

---

## Safety & fairness (what prevents NFT abuse)

To keep matches legitimate:
- Items that affect builds can be **locked/escrowed while equipped**
- Match rewards can be bound to your **loadout hash**
- Ranked outcomes prioritize **skill** and consistent rules

This prevents exploit loops like “equip → win → immediately sell → repeat.”

---

## Where you interact with NFTs

- **In-game:** equip, build, play, unlock progression
- **Website:** official links, contract addresses, docs, drops
- **Marketplace (optional):** trade supported items under the rules

---

## What you gain (summary)
As a player, NFTs give you:
- **ownership** of your identity items
- **market flexibility** to trade into the build you actually want
- a long-term **collection + style** loop that grows with seasons
- all while keeping ranked play skill-first
