# Tomorrow: the future of Masked Wrestlers

Masked Wrestlers is built to scale without breaking competition.

## Seasons without power creep

We introduce new Mask Accessories and cosmetics in seasons, while keeping power bounded by:

- tier restrictions,
- slot limits,
- level gates,
- caps and tradeoffs.

## Community-first growth

- Free-to-play access for new players (no NFT required to learn and compete).
- Creator-friendly assets and lore: masks, factions, arenas, rivalries.
- Tournaments and ranked seasons.

## The long-term vision

A living lucha universe where identity is collectible, gameplay is skillful, and progression is earned—not bought.
