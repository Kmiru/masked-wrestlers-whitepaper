# Executive summary

Masked Wrestlers blends the hype and identity of collectible masks with the competitive clarity of a modern arena fighter:

- **Skill-first combat**: win through reads, spacing, timing, and stamina management.
- **Builds with guardrails**: items expand options, but caps and tradeoffs keep the meta fair.
- **Seasonal content**: new Mask Accessories arrive in seasons, so the game can evolve without inflating power.
