# Executive summary

Masked Wrestlers is a **skill-first competitive fighting game** built around one simple idea:

**Your wins should come from reads, timing, movement, and mastery — not from spending.**

With NFTs, you unlock an optional layer of **ownership, trading, and collectible identity** that helps you curate your perfect loadout over time — while ranked integrity stays protected through caps, tradeoffs, and anti-exploit rules.

## The player fantasy: become your Mask

In Masked Wrestlers, your fighter isn’t just a character pick — it’s a persona you build:
- **Mask** = your identity (and tier)
- **Mask Accessories** = your style knobs (skills/modifiers)
- **Ring Gear** = your visual signature (boots / tights / top / cape)


---

## What you can do (the core loop)

### Fight
- **Ranked PvP:** climb by skill and consistency  
- **Casual PvP:** experiment, warm up, run sets  
- **Training / PvE (where available):** sharpen fundamentals and learn matchups  

### Progress
- Earn **XP → Level 1–1000**
- Unlock milestones that expand your build options over time
- Evolve from beginner to specialist through repetition and mastery

### Customize
Build your loadout from:
1) **1 Mask**
2) **Mask Accessories** (Trait / Moves / Power slots)
3) **Ring Gear** (boots / tights / top / cape)

---

## The competitive promise 
Masked Wrestlers protects fairness with:
- **global caps** (no stat-stacking metas)
- **tradeoffs + counterplay** (every strength has answers)
- **tier / slot / level rules** (structured builds, not chaos)
- **anti-exploit protections** (so match outcomes stay meaningful)

If you win, it’s because you outplayed someone.

---

## NFTs powerful for players who want them

If you choose NFTs, you gain:
- **ownership** of your identity items
- **market flexibility** (trade into the build you actually want)
- **collection goals** through seasonal culture drops and themed sets

The core game remains playable without NFTs — the ownership layer is there to enhance identity and long-term player journeys.
