# Competitive integrity

## The integrity pillars

### 1) Global caps 
Build bonuses are capped so the meta can’t become “stack stats and steamroll.”

### 2) Tradeoffs + counterplay (every strength has answers)
If something boosts your style, it comes with:
- a downside
- constraints
- and counterplay opportunities

This keeps matches interactive and skill-driven.

### 3) Structured builds (tier / slot / level rules)
Customization is powerful, but organized:
- tiers define which slots exist
- slots define what kind of options you can use
- levels unlock access over time (earned through play)

### 4) Anti-exploit protections (no “market abuse” ladder cheating)
Systems can include protections like:
- lock/escrow while equipped (so you can’t abuse equip/sell loops)
- match-bound loadout verification (so results correspond to the build used)

## What this means for you
- Your wins matter
- Your climb feels earned
- Your build expresses your style without replacing skill
- The competitive scene can grow without collapsing into pay-to-win
