# Powered by Masks, Mask Accessories, and Ring Gear

Masked Wrestlers builds are made of three layers:

## 1) Masks (identity + rules)

Each mask belongs to a tier and defines how many accessory slots are available:

- **Common**: 1 accessory slot (Trait)
- **Rare**: 2 accessory slots (Trait + Moves)
- **Legendary**: 3 accessory slots (Trait + Moves + Power)

Power slots exist only for Legendary masks and unlock at higher level.

## 2) Mask Accessories (option-expanding)

Mask Accessories are adornments for the mask (hair, hats, earrings, glasses, etc.) that can also unlock build options. The guiding rule:

- Accessories expand tools **within caps**, not unlimited raw stats.

## 3) Ring Gear (tuned equipment)

Ring Gear is separate equipment parts:

- **Boots** (movement / dash control)
- **Tights** (mobility tradeoffs, stamina efficiency)
- **Top** (defense / guard tuning)
- **Cape** (situational movement tools with strong counterplay)

Ring Gear is designed to be non-NFT by default. If any part becomes tokenized later, it must still obey the same caps and anti-exploit locks.
