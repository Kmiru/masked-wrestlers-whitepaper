# Powered by Masks, Mask Accessories, and Ring Gear

Your identity in Masked Wrestlers is built like a real persona — modular, expressive, and earned.

Your loadout is made of:
1) **1 Mask**
2) **Mask Accessories** (skills/modifiers)
3) **Ring Gear** (boots / tights / top / cape)

## Masks (your persona)
A Mask is your core identity — the thing people recognize.
It defines your tier and the structure of your customization options.

---

## Mask Accessories (your style knobs)
Accessories let you shape how your fighter feels:
- Trait slot (style tuning)
- Moves slot (kit expression)
- Power slot (high-tier expression, still bounded)

Accessories are designed to be:
- capped
- tradeoff-driven
- counterplay-aware

They add variety without breaking ranked integrity.

---

## Ring Gear (your signature look)
Ring Gear is where you flex identity:
- boots
- tights
- top
- cape

Gear can be cosmetic-first, and when it interacts with gameplay it follows the same integrity rules:
caps, tradeoffs, and structured access.

## The best part
Your build becomes recognizable.
Players won’t just remember your name — they’ll remember your Mask.
