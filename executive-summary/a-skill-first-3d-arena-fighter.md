# A skill-first 3D arena fighter

Masked Wrestlers is designed as a **skill-first 3D arena fighter** where your fundamentals matter:
- movement and spacing
- timing and punishes
- stamina/resource decisions
- reads and adaptation

---

## What “skill-first” means
### Skill decides outcomes
- Your wins come from decisions and execution
- You can’t shortcut mastery with purchases

### Customization supports style, not dominance
- Loadouts offer choices that reinforce playstyles
- Advantages are bounded through caps and tradeoffs

### Ranked integrity is protected
- Rules are structured so ladder results remain meaningful
- Anti-exploit protections prevent “market tricks” from affecting competitive play

---

## Playstyles you can own (and actually master)
The system is designed to support multiple styles:
- Pressure (tempo, forcing errors)
- Control (spacing, punishing overcommitments)
- Defense (survive, reset, counter)
- Aerial/mixups (movement and timing traps)


---

## The result
A competitive game where:
- practice matters
- wins feel earned
- identity is deep
- and ranked stays legitimate as the ecosystem grows
