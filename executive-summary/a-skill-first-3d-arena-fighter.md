# A skill-first 3D arena fighter

Masked Wrestlers is built for players who love “the mind game”:

- **Spacing and footwork** matter.
- **Reads and counterplay** exist for every tool.
- **Stamina** is a real resource: aggression has costs.

## Why 3D arena?

3D arenas create more decision branches (angles, turn rate, tracking, positioning). The design goal is to keep those branches competitive by enforcing:

- tight movement caps,
- clear tells on strong tools,
- cooldown and stamina costs for mobility spikes.
