# Masked Wrestlers: an overview

Masked Wrestlers is a fast, technical 3D arena fighter inspired by classic lucha libre.

## Core loop

1. **Choose a Mask** (your identity + ruleset).
2. **Customize your build** with Mask Accessories (optional) and Ring Gear (optional).
3. **Fight** in PvP or PvE modes.
4. **Earn XP** and unlock deeper build options over time.
5. **Adapt** as seasons introduce new playstyles, counters, and cosmetics.

## What “ownership” means here

Ownership is about identity and expression first:

- Masks are **Genesis collectibles** with clear rarity tiers.
- Mask Accessories can be seasonal and tradable (with anti-exploit protections).
- Ring Gear is in-game equipment and is designed to be **non-NFT by default**.
