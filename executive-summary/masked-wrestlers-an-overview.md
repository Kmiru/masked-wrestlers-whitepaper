# Masked Wrestlers: an overview

You can play with zero Web3. If you opt in, NFTs give you **ownership** of your identity items and the ability to **trade into your preferred style** — without breaking ranked.

---

## What kind of game is this?
Masked Wrestlers is built around:
- fast decision-making
- spacing and timing
- stamina/resource control
- matchup learning
- adaptation under pressure

It’s the kind of game where you feel yourself improving every session — and where the ladder means something.

---

## The player loop
1) **Play matches** (ranked/casual/training)  
2) **Earn XP** and progress (Level 1–1000)  
3) **Unlock build options** over time  
4) **Refine your identity** (Mask + Accessories + Ring Gear)  
5) **Return for seasons** (themes, drops, events as they arrive)

---

## Optional ownership, real fairness
If you choose NFTs:
- your Mask and items are yours to keep and trade
- you can curate your inventory instead of being stuck with random drops
- your identity can persist and evolve across seasons

But ranked stays skill-first because:
- bonuses are capped
- tradeoffs create counterplay
- tier/slot/level rules prevent broken builds

---

## Who this is for
- Competitive players who want a serious ladder
- Players who love identity, style, and persona-building
- Collector-players who enjoy seasons and themed culture drops
- Anyone who wants a fair game first — with optional ownership later

If you want a fighting game you can grind for years, while building a persona that feels like yours, you’re in the right place.
