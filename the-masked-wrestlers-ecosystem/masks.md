# Masks

## Genesis supply

Genesis Masks are fixed supply for clarity and collectibility:

- **1000 total** Genesis Masks
- split across tiers (Common / Rare / Legendary)

Future seasons can introduce *new* mask collections, while Genesis remains capped.

## Slots by tier

- Common: 1 slot (Trait)
- Rare: 2 slots (Trait + Moves)
- Legendary: 3 slots (Trait + Moves + Power)
