# Mask Accessories (Patches) — Skills that shape how you fight

Patches are where your build becomes personal.

These aren’t “stickers.”
Patches add **skills/abilities and modifiers** that influence how your fighter plays:
- Trait tuning (your rhythm)
- Moves expression (your kit flavor)
- Power expression (high-tier expression, still bounded)

## The Patch system in numbers (clear and structured)

### Slots
- **Trait**
- **Moves**
- **Power**

### Build impact (by design)
Patches are made to:
- add identity AND gameplay
- create specialization paths
- stay fair through structure

---

## Why Patches don’t break ranked
Every Patch is built with competitive integrity rules:
- **caps** (so nothing scales out of control)
- **tradeoffs** (power always costs something)
- **counterplay** (opponents have answers)
- tier/slot/level restrictions (structure and readability)

So you can build smart…
but you still have to play smarter.
