# Gamification (Level 1–1000: the grind that feels good)

Masked Wrestlers is designed to keep you hungry:
- one more match
- one more win streak
- one more milestone unlock
- one more build refinement

---

## Progression in numbers
- **Level 1–1000**
- Milestones unlock access to deeper build expression

Example milestone-style gating:
- Trait access can begin early (ex: Level 8)
- Power expression is reserved for deeper progression (ex: Level 50+)
(Exact tuning is balance-driven.)

## Why progression matters in a competitive game
Progression isn’t there to replace skill.
It’s there to reward commitment with:
- access (more build expression)
- identity (more personalization)
- goals (reasons to return)

The best part:
your gameplay improvement is always the main reward.
Progression simply makes the journey feel legendary.
