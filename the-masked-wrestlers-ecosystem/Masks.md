# Masks (Your persona, your reputation)

A Mask isn’t a skin.
It’s your presence.

It’s how players recognize you in the lobby.
It’s how they remember you after a set.
It’s how they know the next fight is going to be serious.

## What a Mask represents
- your identity
- your tier foundation
- your build structure
- your long-term presence in the ecosystem

A great competitive game creates icons.
Masked Wrestlers starts that process with Masks.
