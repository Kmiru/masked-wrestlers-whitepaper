# Mask Accessories (Patches)

Patches add skills/abilities and modifiers that shape your style.

## What Patches give you
- playstyle tuning (traits/modifiers)
- kit expression (moves)
- power expression (bounded, counterplay-aware)

## Why Patches stay fair
Every patch is designed with:
- caps
- tradeoffs
- counterplay
- tier/slot/level structure

That means you can build creatively while fights stay competitive and readable.
