# Marketplace & Assets

Masked Wrestlers gives you a build system with real depth—so the market isn’t just “collecting.”
It’s **curation**.

The market exists to let you:
- trade into the style that fits your hands
- evolve with the meta
- build a collection that matches your identity

---

## What players do with the market

### 1) Trade toward a playstyle
You don’t want random.
You want “this feels like me.”

- Pressure builds
- Control builds
- Defensive counter builds
- Movement/mixup builds

The market helps you chase the exact components that support your approach.

### 2) Upgrade your identity, not just your stats
Your persona becomes recognizable through:
- your Mask
- your Top/Cape style
- the way your Patch skills shape your rhythm

### 3) Stay flexible as the ecosystem evolves
When new Patches or Gear arrive:
- you can pivot
- you can specialize further
- you can complete themed sets across seasons

---

## What the ecosystem protects

The market adds flexibility—**not guaranteed wins**—because:
- bonuses are capped
- tradeoffs create counterplay
- tier/slot/level rules enforce structure
- anti-exploit systems prevent “market abuse” from affecting outcomes
