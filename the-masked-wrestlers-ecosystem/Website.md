# Website

The website is your home base:
- verified links
- the whitepaper
- official announcements
- drops / releases (as scheduled)
- events and tournament info (as the scene grows)

## Why players need an official hub
Competitive scenes thrive on clarity.
The website exists so you always know:
- what’s real
- what’s next
- what’s worth chasing

It’s the place you point your friends to when they ask:
“Okay, what is Masked Wrestlers and why does it look sick?”
