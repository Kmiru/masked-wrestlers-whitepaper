# Arena World (Where highlights become history)

Masked Wrestlers is built to create “clip moments”:
- the perfect bait
- the clean punish
- the stamina read
- the last-second outplay

The arena isn’t background decoration—it's designed to make combat readable and skill expressive.

## What makes arena combat feel good

### Movement that matters
Spacing isn’t cosmetic. It’s your advantage.
You win neutral by:
- positioning
- timing
- predicting reactions

### Timing windows you can master
The best competitive games are readable:
- you learn punish timings
- you learn safe vs risky choices
- you learn when to commit

### Stamina/resource decisions that reward brains
A great fighter isn’t just faster.
It’s smarter:
- when to pressure
- when to reset
- when to bait the panic option

## Why the world matters to the ecosystem
The arena is where your Mask becomes a reputation.
The goal is simple:
**make every fight feel like it meant something.**
