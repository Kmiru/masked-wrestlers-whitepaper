# The Masked Wrestlers Ecosystem (How YOU become a legend)

Masked Wrestlers isn’t just “a fighting game.” It’s a **competitive ecosystem** where your skill grows, your build evolves, and your identity becomes recognizable.

This section explains how everything connects—from your Mask to your skills to your progression—so you always know:
- **what you own**
- **what you equip**
- **what you unlock**
- **what you can trade**
- **how you climb**
- and why the ladder stays **legit**

## The ecosystem in 30 seconds (player view)

### Your loadout is a real build
Your fighter is built from **7 core pieces**:

1) **Mask** (your persona + tier foundation)  
2) **Patch: Trait** (playstyle tuning)  
3) **Patch: Moves** (kit expression)  
4) **Patch: Power** (high-tier expression, still bounded)  
5) **Ring Gear: Boots**  
6) **Ring Gear: Tights**  
7) **Ring Gear: Top** + **Cape**

Not every slot is available immediately. That’s part of the chase.

### Your progression is long-term
- **Level 1–1000**
- Milestones unlock access to deeper build expression
- Your account doesn’t just “reset your identity”—you build a legacy

### Your wins stay meaningful
Build depth never replaces mastery because the system enforces:
- **caps** (no infinite stacking)
- **tradeoffs + counterplay** (every advantage has answers)
- **tier / slot / level rules** (structured builds)
- anti-exploit protections (so the market can’t cheat the ladder)

## What makes this ecosystem addictive

### 1) You’re always improving
You’ll feel your growth in:
- movement and spacing
- timing and punish windows
- stamina/resource decisions
- reads and adaptation

### 2) You’re always refining your build
Your loadout becomes a personal signature:
- “This player is pressure.”
- “That player is control.”
- “That Mask always baits punishes.”
- “That build is patient… until it explodes.”

### 3) You’re always chasing the next milestone
Progression isn’t a number—it’s access:
- more build expression
- more strategic options
- more identity depth

---

## Example scale (so it feels real)
A concrete v1 catalog can look like:
- **60 Patches** (skills/modifiers across tiers and slots)
- **80 Ring Gear items** (Boots/Tights/Top/Cape)
= **140 build components** that players can mix, match, and specialize around.

As seasons expand, the ecosystem grows—but always under integrity rules.
