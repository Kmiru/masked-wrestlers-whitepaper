# Gamification

## Level 1–1000 progression

Progression is long-term, but build power stays bounded by caps and tradeoffs.

### XP to level up

A smooth XP curve example:

`XP_next(L) = 80 + 4L + 0.06L^2`

### Useful milestones

- **Level 8** (Common Trait enabled): ~680 XP
- **Level 50** (Power enabled): ~11,245 XP
- **Level 1000** (total): ~22,047,930 XP

## Why level gates?

Level gates ensure that “high-impact” tools are earned through playtime, not bought. In practice:

- new players can compete early with fundamentals,
- advanced tools unlock after you’ve learned the game.
